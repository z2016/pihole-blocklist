# pihole-blocklist

This is a comprehensive, occassionally updated blocklist of child unsafe domains, for use in DNS filter like Pi-Hole. It currently has over 1.9M domains in the blocklist. I am a father of two children and use this blocklist in my home network to make my network as family friendly as possible.

To use, add the URL below to Pi-Holes Admin -> Group Management -> Adlists page in the Pi-Hole administrative interface.

There is no guarantee that every unsafe website out in the wild will be blocked in this list. You should add other lists, including the default ones provided by Pi-Hole installer in addition to this one to make your network as safe as possible.
